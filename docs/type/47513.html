During the outpost migration event all Amarr Manufacturing Outposts were converted into these new faction Fortizars, and after that event no more copies of this structure or its blueprints have been made available to capsuleers.

The 'Draccous' Fortizar enjoys all of the capabilities of a standard Fortizar citadel alongside reinforced armor plating and enhanced manufacturing facilities. It is named for the "Draccous Station" of 0OYZ-G, the first ever Amarr Manufacturing Outpost to be deployed by capsuleers.

The Fortizar has been built with new spaceship tethering technology as standard, and will readily accommodate most ships, including freighters and even capital ships, in its internal docking bays. While the docks are unable to service 'supercapital' level vessels, the defensive capabilities of the Fortizar are considerably enhanced in lower security star systems with the ability to mount area effect weapons. The Fortizar can be configured using Upwell's Standup brand service and structure modules so as to serve the specific needs of the structure operator. Further adjustment of the hardware of the Fortizar can be achieved by installed Standup L-Set rigs to optimize the specific role of the citadel.</td></tr><tr><td>Japanese</td><td>'Draccous' Fortizar</td><td>The 'Draccous'-class upgraded Fortizar is a special edition structure released in limited numbers to capsuleers by the Upwell Consortium as part of their outpost migration project of YC120.
